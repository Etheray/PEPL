**Project Ether Public SubLicense Version 1.0 (PEPSL)**

**Introduction**

The Project Ether Public SubLicense Version 1.0 (referred to as “PEPSL”) establishes the terms under which any derivative works or modifications of projects originally licensed under the Project Ether Public License Version 1.0 (PEPL) may be distributed, copied, and modified. PEPSL is designed to allow the free use, modification, and distribution of covered projects, while strictly prohibiting commercial use and requiring that all distributed copies, whether modified or unmodified, be licensed exclusively under PEPSL. Additionally, this License provides special permissions for original authors of the source project, defined herein, granting them permanent access and use rights. By copying, modifying, distributing, or using any content governed by PEPSL, you (“Licensee”) agree to comply with the terms and conditions of this License.

**Section 1: Definitions**

For the purposes of PEPSL, the following terms are defined as follows:

1. **"Project"** refers to any work, whether software, code, documentation, data, media, or other material, which has been originally licensed under the Project Ether Public License Version 1.0 (PEPL) and is subject to PEPSL by way of modification, adaptation, or derivation from the original PEPL-licensed work.

2. **“Original Author(s) of the Source Project”** refers to all individuals or entities who have created, contributed to, or hold copyright in any project released under PEPL, and whose work or contributions have been directly or indirectly utilized in the development of any subsequent project licensed under PEPSL. This term specifically includes all contributors to any source project under PEPL that served as a basis for works covered under PEPSL.

3. **“Licensee”** refers to any individual, entity, organization, or contributor who receives, accesses, copies, modifies, or distributes the Project, in whole or in part, under the terms set forth in this License.

4. **“Commercial Use”** refers to any activity that generates or aims to generate direct or indirect financial gain, revenue, or commercial advantage, including but not limited to selling, licensing, renting, leasing, charging for access, or using the Project as part of any product, service, or offering intended for commercial purposes.

5. **"Non-Commercial Use"** refers to any use, distribution, or modification of the Project that does not generate direct or indirect financial gain. Non-Commercial Use includes private, academic, educational, or research purposes, provided they comply with the terms and restrictions set forth in this License.

6. **“Modification” or “Modify”** means any act that alters, adapts, improves, translates, or otherwise changes the original Project or any part of it, resulting in a derived or adapted version. All modifications, whether minor or substantial, fall under the jurisdiction of PEPSL and are subject to the same terms as the original Project.

7. **"Distribution" or “Distribute”** refers to any act that makes copies of the Project, whether modified or unmodified, available to any third party by any means, including but not limited to electronic transmission, public display, physical copying, or any other method of transfer.

8. **“Revocation”** means the right of the original author(s) to rescind or revoke permissions granted under this License, with the exception of the irrevocable rights granted to the Original Author(s) of the Source Project as specified in this License.

9. **“Authorized Copy”** refers to any copy of the Project that has been distributed, modified, or accessed in compliance with the terms of this License. Unauthorized copies are those that have been distributed, modified, or accessed in violation of PEPSL.

**Section 2: Grant of License**

1. **Permission to Distribute and Copy**: Subject to the terms of PEPSL, the Licensee is hereby granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to copy and distribute the Project for Non-Commercial Use only. This license does not extend to Commercial Use, and any such unauthorized use constitutes a violation of this License.

2. **Permission to Modify**: Licensees are permitted to modify the Project under the condition that all modified versions of the Project are distributed under the terms of PEPSL. Any modification of the Project must retain the original PEPSL license text and all notices, and the modified Project must be re-licensed exclusively under PEPSL.

3. **No Additional Licensing Terms**: Licensees are prohibited from imposing any additional terms, conditions, or restrictions on the Project or any modified version. All modified and distributed versions must adhere strictly to PEPSL.

4. **Revocation of Non-Commercial License**: The original author(s) retain the right to revoke this license for any Licensee who fails to adhere to the terms of PEPSL. However, this revocation does not affect the rights granted to the Original Author(s) of the Source Project, as specified in Section 6.

5. **Non-Sublicensable License**: This License does not permit the Licensee to sublicense or transfer rights to any third party. Any attempt to transfer, sublicense, or assign rights under PEPSL is prohibited and constitutes grounds for immediate revocation.

6. **No Implicit Rights**: This License does not grant any rights not explicitly outlined within this License. No additional rights are implied, including but not limited to patents, trademarks, or any proprietary rights associated with the Project.

**Section 3: Requirements for Modification and Distribution**

1. **Distribution Under PEPSL Only**: All copies, modifications, and derivative works of the Project must be distributed exclusively under the terms of PEPSL. No Licensee may distribute the Project, modified or unmodified, under any other license or sublicense, nor add any additional restrictions or terms.

2. **Retain License Text**: Any copy, distribution, or modification of the Project must include the complete, unaltered text of this License, as well as any original copyright notices or attributions. Licensees must ensure that all copies, whether modified or unmodified, retain the full PEPSL license without any alteration.

3. **Attribution Requirements**: The Licensee must include a clear and prominent attribution to the Original Author(s) in all copies or public displays of the Project, whether modified or unmodified. Attribution must reference the Original Author(s) of the Source Project and provide acknowledgment that the work is licensed under PEPSL.

4. **Identification of Modifications**: If the Project is modified, the Licensee must clearly indicate that modifications have been made, include a description of the nature and extent of the modifications, and provide the date on which modifications were made. Modified versions of the Project must not imply endorsement by the Original Author(s) or any contributors to the Source Project.

5. **Non-Commercial Restriction Enforcement**: Licensees agree not to use or distribute the Project for any Commercial Use. Any distribution, even for Non-Commercial Use, must include a clear notice that commercial exploitation of the Project is strictly prohibited under PEPSL.

6. **Prevention of Unauthorized Use**: The Licensee must take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized Commercial Use or distribution of the Project by any third party who receives the Project from them. Any distribution of the Project by the Licensee that enables or facilitates unauthorized Commercial Use constitutes a violation of PEPSL and may lead to revocation of the License.

---

**Section 4: Revocation of License**

1. **Revocation by Original Authors**: The Original Author(s) may revoke any License granted under PEPSL at their discretion, for any reason, and at any time, with respect to any Licensee who has violated the terms of PEPSL. This revocation applies only to Licensees who are not Original Author(s) of the Source Project.

2. **Notice of Revocation**: Upon revocation, the Original Author(s) will notify the violating Licensee in writing or electronically. Revocation becomes effective immediately upon notification, and the Licensee must immediately cease all use, modification, and distribution of the Project.

3. **Limitations on Revocation for Distributed Copies**: If the Project has been lawfully distributed to a publicly accessible, single webpage, that webpage may retain an unmodified copy of the Project, provided no further distribution occurs. However, the Licensee must cease any new distributions and remove the Project from any other sites or channels.

4. **Scope of Revocation**: Revocation applies to all current and future rights to use, distribute, modify, or otherwise access the Project. Previously authorized copies that were legally distributed under PEPSL may remain accessible only if they do not engage in further distribution or modification post-revocation.

5. **Non-Retroactive Application of Revocation**: Revocation does not affect any prior distributions or actions that were in full compliance with PEPSL at the time they were undertaken. However, all future distributions, modifications, or uses are immediately terminated upon revocation.

**Section 5: Prohibited Commercial Use**

1. **Strict Ban on Commercial Use**: Licensees are strictly prohibited from using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Project, whether in its original form or as modified, for any Commercial Use without express, prior written consent from the Original Author(s).

2. **Examples of Prohibited Commercial Use**: The prohibition on Commercial Use includes, but is not limited to, the following actions:

   - **Selling Copies or Access**: Selling, licensing, renting, leasing, or otherwise profiting from the Project directly, whether the Project is in its original form, as a derivative work, or incorporated as a component of another product or service.
   
   - **Subscription or Paid Access Services**: Offering the Project as part of a paid subscription service, paid membership, or any other access-controlled service in which users are charged for direct or indirect access to the Project or any derivative version thereof.
   
   - **Advertising Revenue and Monetization**: Hosting, displaying, or distributing the Project on platforms or websites that generate revenue through advertisements, sponsorships, affiliate links, or any other monetized content models. This applies even if the revenue is not directly tied to the Project but is generated by traffic or engagement related to the Project.

   - **Marketplace Listings and Commercial Platforms**: Distributing, listing, or making the Project available on digital marketplaces, e-commerce platforms, or any commercial digital distribution channels where the Project or access to it is monetized, regardless of whether the Project itself is sold or monetized as part of a bundle.

   - **Corporate, Internal, and Enterprise Use**: Using the Project within a corporate, enterprise, or organizational setting where it is directly or indirectly associated with profit-driven business activities, operations, research, or services. This restriction applies regardless of whether the Project is used internally or externally as part of any business process.

   - **Indirect Monetization**: Engaging in indirect monetization strategies where the Project serves to drive traffic, attract an audience, or generate interest in other commercial products or services. This includes promotional usage, such as embedding the Project in content designed to promote a commercial brand or product, even if the Project itself is not directly sold.

3. **Indirect Violation Provisions**: Any attempt by a Licensee to circumvent the Non-Commercial Use restriction through indirect means, such as by using intermediaries, third-party facilitators, affiliates, or associated entities to exploit the Project commercially, will be considered a direct violation of this License and will result in immediate revocation of all rights granted to the Licensee.

4. **Consequences for Unauthorized Commercial Use**: In the event that the Licensee is found to have engaged in prohibited Commercial Use of the Project, the Original Author(s) retain the right to:
   
   - Revoke the License with immediate effect, nullifying all rights to access, modify, distribute, or use the Project.
   - Pursue legal action to recover any revenue, profit, or advantage gained by the Licensee from unauthorized Commercial Use of the Project.
   - Seek injunctive relief or other appropriate legal remedies to prevent ongoing or future unauthorized Commercial Use of the Project.
   - Hold the Licensee responsible for any costs, damages, or expenses incurred by the Original Author(s) as a result of the Licensee’s unauthorized Commercial Use.

5. **No Reinstatement after Commercial Violation**: Once a License has been revoked due to a violation of the Commercial Use restriction, it may not be reinstated under any circumstances. The Licensee may not reapply for or be regranted any rights to use, modify, or distribute the Project following a revocation triggered by unauthorized Commercial Use.

**Section 6: Permanent License for Original Authors of the Source Project**

1. **Irrevocable Access and Use Rights**: All Original Authors of the Source Project are granted a permanent, irrevocable license to access, copy, distribute, and modify the Project, including any derivative works or modifications thereof, under PEPSL without restriction. This license remains in effect regardless of any future changes to the Project or modifications to this License.

3. **Unrestricted Modification and Distribution**: Original Authors of the Source Project retain the right to freely modify, distribute, and make derivative works of the Project without being required to credit or seek approval from any subsequent authors or contributors who have licensed their modifications under PEPSL.

4. **No Attribution Required to Subsequent Authors**: When distributing or modifying the Project, Original Authors of the Source Project are not required to attribute or recognize any modifications, contributions, or derivatives created by Licensees under PEPSL. This ensures that Original Authors of the Source Project maintain complete autonomy over their contributions without obligation to subsequent contributors.

5. **Scope of Permanent Rights**: The rights granted to the Original Authors of the Source Project are non-transferable but may be exercised in perpetuity. These rights include, but are not limited to:
   
   - The ability to integrate the Project into other works, whether or not they are licensed under PEPSL.
   - The ability to distribute modifications of the Project in formats and under terms other than those specified in PEPSL, provided such distribution does not violate the terms of PEPL for the Source Project.

6. **Non-Commercial Limitation Exemption**: Original Authors of the Source Project are not bound by the Non-Commercial Use restriction of PEPSL when using their own contributions. This exemption allows them to use, modify, and distribute their contributions, including derivative works based on their contributions, without restriction, even if such use might otherwise be considered Commercial Use under PEPSL.
